# NCBI_API
Program which features multiple api calls to ncbi to retreive and format information about genes related to certain conditions
Note: will have to change the api key to your own, or eliminate that parameter in the url for each api call.
Returns information about the top number of genes (you set that number) associated with that specific condition such as gene name, chromosome location, gene ID (in NCBIs gene database), gene map location, nucleotide start and stop position, and exon count.
